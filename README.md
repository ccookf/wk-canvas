# WaniKani Canvas

The other canvas services had unpleasant limitations so I made this as an experiment. Anyone may view the canvas, but only users with a WaniKani account at level 4 or higher may paint the canvas.

I currently have a server running on AWS.
[Check out the client here!](https://ccookf.com/canvas)

## Server

node, express, socket.io, node-png

## Client

socket.io, jQuery       

### Todo list

* ~~Chunking the canvas~~
* Pretend I'm a CSS wizard
